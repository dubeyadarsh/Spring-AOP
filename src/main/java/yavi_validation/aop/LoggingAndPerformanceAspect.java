/**
 * Let's first understand some @keywords used in AOP :
 
 1) JoinPoint : A JoinPoint represents a point during the execution of a program where an aspect can be applied.
                It provides access to the method being executed, its arguments, and other details.
                
 2) PointCut :A PointCut is an expression that matches certain methods in the application.
 			  It defines the "where" in the code where advice (action) should be applied.
  			  A PointCut can be used to specify the methods to intercept based on criteria such as method names or parameters.
 
 3) Advice :  Advice is the action taken by an aspect at a specific JoinPoint.
 			  It defines "what" should be done when the PointCut expression matches.
  			  Common types of advice include @Before, @After, @Around, and @AfterThrowing.
  			  
 4) AOP Proxies : AOP Proxies are objects created by the AOP framework to intercept method calls.
  				 They act as intermediaries between the client code and the actual target object.
  					There are two types of proxies: JDK Dynamic Proxy (for interfaces) and CGLIB Proxy (for classes).
 
 5) PointCut Designator : Spring AOP supports the following AspectJ pointcut designators (PCD) for use in pointcut expressions:
 						a) execution  b) within  c) this d)target and manymore.

 /**
  * 
  * Flow of Execution with AOP:
	1) Request to Controller: When a request is made to a method in the controller, it first goes through the proxy.
    2) PointCut Matching: The proxy checks if the method matches any PointCut expression youâ€™ve defined.
	 Advice Execution:
    3) Before advice: Runs before the method executes.
	4) Method Execution: If the PointCut matches, the method is executed (via joinPoint.proceed() in an @Around advice).	
	5) After advice: Executes after the method, whether it completes normally or throws an exception.
	6) Return to Client: The proxy then returns the result of the method (or a value modified by the advice) to the client.
